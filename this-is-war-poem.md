# A poem I wrote, in the style of the famous war poet Wilfred Owen
## This is war.

Dead paupers bent double,

Begging for their sold life with trouble.

A whole regiment down in a day,

Thanks to the guns, stuttering away.

Oh! and another man down,

His body without his crown.

Splat, splat, splat, go the swollen feet;

The sound made during a hasty retreat.

Massive, muddy rats galore.

This is war.

--

Shells tiring, men trudging,

All marching towards their judging.

And another man falls to the disease,

Everyone worries about the breeze.

GAS! Quick, get the mask on!

But there is one who is gone.

Pop, pop, pop, go the gunsâ€™ breath;

The destroying sound of Death.

Trenches full of gore.

This is war.

--

The higher-ups embellish the greatness

Of war, and how it makes you famous.

But the reality is just a medal,

Only a shiny piece of metal.

All ending in shame,

And no one to blame.

A life done for.

This is war.
