# What is next for the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin?

Bitcoin: the currency that doesn't tangibly exist but everyone still knows about.
Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017. Nowadays, one bitcoin is approximately equal to £25000, or $35000!

There is one way to obtain Bitcoin without buying it directly: mining it. People compete to “mine” bitcoins using computers to solve complex math puzzles. This is how bitcoins are created. Currently, a winner is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes.

Bitcoins are stored in a “digital wallet,” which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer. The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unlike bank accounts, bitcoin wallets are not insured.

Recently, China cracked down on Bitcoin and prohibited its mining, meaning that anyone caught mining Bitcoin with any evidence at hand could be arrested.

Additionally, Elon Musk has bargained on the Bitcoin market with a series of clever tweets and actions with his car company Tesla: he tweeted about Tesla accepting Bitcoin as payment, and the price immediately shot up, after which he presumably sold it, and then tweeted about Bitcoin's impact on the environment and proceeded to not accept it as payment for Tesla cars.

I think Bitcoin's price will keep gradually increasing, however not to $200000 (that has been speculated over the past few months by various persons), and that it is here to stay.
