How I am going to make a difference to the world...
I want to make a difference to the world by eradicating the biggest killer of humankind.
This “killer” is a non-communicable disease - ischaemic heart disease. This disease alone caused 9
million deaths in 2016i

. Non-communicable diseases are diseases that cannot be transmitted by
humans, but are usually caused by lifestyle or genes. It is possible to have an excellent lifestyle and
trump your genes, meaning you won’t get a non-communicable disease one of your immediate
ancestors had, but it is difficult. Ischaemic heart disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is
the term given to heart problems caused by reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart because of
narrowed arteries, depriving the heart muscles of oxygen. The arteries are narrowed over time
because of fatty deposits inside the arteriesii
.

I would like to make a difference by reducing the number of deaths due to coronary heart disease –
the top killer which claims more lives than the next two largest causes of death. The underlying
cause of heart disease – narrowed arteries – is also a contributing factor to stroke and dementia,
themselves in the top 10 killers in their own right. By tackling the causes of coronary heart disease
alone, I would be able to cause a significant drop in the amount of deaths caused by coronary heart
disease, stroke and dementia.


This is a problem worth solving because increasing human longevity will directly improve overall
prosperity of the human race: A longer life, better life quality, spending more time with people we
love as we get older, and the ability to accomplish more things, with more room for ambition, and
not having to worry about a will for a long time. When a person lives longer, they collect more
knowledge and disseminate that knowledge to help their kin learn from them. This is popularly
known as the “Grandmother effect”iii and benefits the extended family overall.
My mum lost two of her grandparents to cardiovascular diseases. Growing up, I have often heard
stories of my mum saying how her grandparents death impacted her as a child, as she used to live
with them. One of my great-grandmothers died of a stroke, after contracting vascular dementia
(dementia caused by a narrowed arteries reducing blood flow/oxygen to the brain),which caused
cardiomegaly (an enlarged heart), and arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). Also, her mental state
was not helped by the fact that my great-grandfather had recently passed away, due to cardiac arrest.
My grandparents currently take statins, a class of drugs that help to lower cholesterol, and, by
lowering the cholesterol levels, they help prevent fat build-up in arteries, reducing cardiac arrests
and strokes. Statin drugs work by blocking the action of the liver enzyme that is responsible for
producing cholesterol. Too much cholesterol in the blood can cause a build-up of plaque on the
walls of the arteries, which, in turn, can cause the arteries to eventually narrow or harden. Sudden
blood clots in these blocked arteries can cause a heart attack or stroke.ivMy grandparents are also
quite keen on changing their lifestyle to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease but they still feel
they could have started early on the positive changes if they had been more aware of the risks
involved.
When we look at historical trends in longevity, the biggest killers have not always been the same. In
the 1900s, infectionsv

were the biggest killer: people did not live long enough to die by non-
communicable diseases, but over the course of time, our medicines and antibiotics improved. Now

people get cured of infections better and faster but we fight against even harder to cure diseases
than before, with less awareness. We are resilient species and work well as a society – just as we
tackled deaths due to infection, we would be able to tackle deaths due to heart disease.
I understand that I am only a secondary school student with limited resources, but I feel I can still
make a difference. I would like to start with my local community, spreading awareness and changes
within my home, my neighbourhood, my school and my town. All of this would need minimal


infrastructure but a large amount of my time and planning. As the initiative gets bigger I am sure I
will be able to recruit other interested volunteers and Redingensians to this cause.
Media plays a huge role in a person’s life. We are influenced by media much more than we think.
Negative media does this exceptionally well e.g. Terrorist attacks are reported all over the world, in
many news channels, however the amount of people killed in terrorist attacks is barely a fraction of
the amount of people killed by coronary heart disease. In 2016, coronary heart disease and stroke
killed 15.4 million people , whereas terrorism killed 34,871 peoplevi. While there is no direct
comparison studies of media coverage of coronary heart disease versus terrorism, I am sure most of
our empirical evidence would agree that terrorism is covered a lot more than coronary heart disease.
I am not arguing for covering less terrorism but I am arguing for more coverage of the biggest
killers.
My efforts can be multiplied manifold if I can convince news organisations on this strategy – I
would start with convincing my local news media. They would need to see the demand for the
coverage on this topics and need researchers from universities to provide credible sources. I can
setup a local media centre to bring these three parties together with the aim of disseminating more
media coverage on coronary heart disease. Once the local media are on board I am sure the bigger
media houses would see the trend and catch on to it. The media centre can then be scaled to work
nationwide and eventually worldwide.
The increased media coverage would result in more people being aware of these conditions and
their own risk factors which could contribute to coronary hear disease. They would also be more
vigilant on the telltale signs and make positive changes to their lifestyle and reduce the risk factors
that can cause coronary heart disease.
As my future career choice, I want to research on curing diseases using computational
biochemistry, which is essentially using a computer to simulate ways to cure diseases, infections or
to edit genes. Becoming an expert in this field would allow me to come up with novel ways to find
and edit the genes which makes people susceptible to coronary heart disease. This does have a huge
risk, though: we could create super humans who are not susceptible to these diseases but have
different problems of their own.
Increasing the longevity of the world population comes with its own problems as well: it would
create more stress on natural resources in the world, as people would live longer, consume more
resources and the world would be stretched to its limit. However, there is a simple solution to this

problem: The Education and Empowerment of Women! Most low income countries have high
fertility rates and low women empowerment. Empowering and educating women gives them more
choices than getting married early and having children. Giving them control over their life results in
a lower fertility ratevii. This would mean a better, stable world as the population growth would slow
to balance out the longer living people.
The second problem with increasing longevity would be the quality of life for the elderly. This is a
slightly more easier problem to solve with the help of technology. The current boom in wearables
can be utilised to change the regular habits of middle aged people to include more exercise which
would have positive impact on them as they get older. Japan is currently leading way in producing
and utilising humanoid robots for elderly care.viiiWith the advancements in the field of my future
career, there would be lots of solutions to improve the quality of life of the elderly by genetically
modifying their own bodies to live longer and better.
To conclude, we can tackle the current biggest killer of humankind – coronary heart disease by
change in lifestyle of people at risk by an exponential increase in awareness surrounding it and
working on longer term solutions by making use of cutting edge computational biochemistry. To
reduce the impact of increased longevity we would also need to educate and empower women to
lower the fertility rates and work on technological solutions to improve the quality of life as we live
longer.
